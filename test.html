    <p> This is just a little information about myself</p>
  </div>
  <p>so omg just typing random stuff just becuase of reasons....</p>
  <p> Ok so my name is obviously Sharon. I have four pets, two cats, two dogs. They are all crazy little beasties, and love to get attention. Though the dogs look tough they are the most gentle dogs I have enver encountered. I also have one sister who I have grown up with, and seven step siblings that I have not.</p>
  <p> I love most things fantasy/scifi related. It has been ingrained in me since birth as my parents are scifi/fantasy nerds, though they aren't into video games as much as we are (my sister and myself), and they do no interfere with the fact that my sister and I do.</p> 
  <p>I like being active and love martial arts, I have learned a few types, and also a Japanese Sword art (Toyama Ryu) which I loved learning because of the tradition behind the art itself, and we had to learn and follow those exact traditions.</p>
  <p> singing is a strong suite of mine, though i don't show it off often, I am in the mists of persuing a career in that, as slow as it may be in the beginning I hope to be doing something with it soon.</p>
  <p> That is all</p>
